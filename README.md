# warmWaterConsumptionComputerVision

This repo contains the source code to analyze a warm water counter.
Currently the OCR is returning bad results and the segmentation of the letters it not very robust.

## Recommended Hardware
Raspberry Pi
Rasperry Pi Camera (non infrared version)
power source cable
if raspberry pi 2 a wifi dongle
cables
LEDs
soldering iron

## Cost

You can use a different computer and a different camera. Note that the script for image capturing is inteded to run on a raspberry pi.

## Problems I encountered
The wifi dongle did not run. There are several sold on amazon by chinese merchants under different names. The one I ordered came with a little disk (who uses those little disks today?).

My camera did not work after I installed it. Removing or adding the camera to the pi while running can probably damage the camera. Either it was already broken or I damaged it.
